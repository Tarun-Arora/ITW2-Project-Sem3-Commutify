### Before Starting Server Make Sure Your Redis Server is Running
	sudo docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5

## API ENDPOINTS

We are including the description of the API for your reference.

### Auth System

For this API, you will have to use Token-based Authorization. All the requests made to the API (except the Login and Register endpoints) shall need an  **Authorization header**  with a valid token and the prefix  **Token**.

The authorization header shall have the following format:
`Authorization: Token <token>`

-   `POST /auth/login/`
    Takes the username and password as input, validates them and returns the **Token**, if the credentials are valid.  
  
	Request Body (Sample):
	```
	{
	  "username": "string",
	  "password": "string"
	}
	```
	Response Body (Sample):
	```
	{
	  "token":  "string"
	}
	```
	Response Code: `200`

-   `POST /auth/register/`

	Register a user in Django by taking the name, email, username and password as input.
  
	Request Body (Sample):
	```
	{
	    "username": "string",
	    "email": "user@example.com",
	    "password": "string"
        "first_name": "string",
        "last_name": "string", 
        "dob": "YYYY/MM/DD"

	```
